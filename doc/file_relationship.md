# Basketball Dataset Documentation

## Dataset Overview
This collection of files provides comprehensive basketball game statistics and metrics for analyzing team performance and creating advanced analytics like RAPTOR ratings.

## File Structure

### 1. games_2022.csv
**Purpose**: Raw game-by-game statistics for the 2022 season
- Contains basic game statistics
- Each row represents one team's performance in a single game
- Includes both teams' statistics in separate rows for each game
- Primary source for game-level analysis

### 2. merged_team_games.csv
**Purpose**: Enhanced version of games data with additional regional information
- Builds upon games_2022.csv
- Adds regional classification for teams
- Enables regional performance analysis
- Facilitates geographic trend analysis

### 3. data_dictionary.md
**Purpose**: Reference documentation for understanding data fields
- Defines all columns and metrics
- Provides context for statistical calculations
- Explains measurement units and formats
- Essential for accurate data interpretation

    B -->|Enables| D[Regional Analysis]
    A -->|Enables| E[Game Analysis]
```

## Key Relationships

1. **Game Identification**
   - Both data files use `game_id` as primary key
   - Format: game_YEAR_NUMBER
   - Enables cross-referencing between files

2. **Team Information**
   ```
   games_2022.csv        merged_team_games.csv
   └── team      ─────── └── team
                         └── region (additional)
   ```

3. **Statistical Continuity**
   - Core statistics remain consistent across files
   - Same measurement units and formats
   - Enables reliable comparative analysis

## Use Cases

1. **Basic Game Analysis**
   - Use games_2022.csv for:
     * Individual game statistics
     * Team performance metrics
     * Head-to-head comparisons

2. **Regional Analysis**
   - Use merged_team_games.csv for:
     * Regional performance trends
     * Geographic impact on performance
     * Regional competitive analysis

3. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Combine both files for:
     * RAPTOR rating calculations
     * Complex performance metrics
     * Multi-dimensional analysis

## Data Flow

1. **Collection Phase**
   ```
   Game Events → Basic Statistics → games_2022.csv
   ```
