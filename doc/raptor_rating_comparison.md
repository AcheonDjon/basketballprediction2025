# RAPTOR Rating Component Comparison

## Detailed Component Analysis

| Component | Current RAPTOR | Enhanced RAPTOR | Impact of Change |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Shooting Efficiency** | 30% weight on eFG% | 25% weight on eFG% | More balanced consideration of different game aspects |
| **Net Rating** | 25% raw impact | 20% adjusted for opposition | Better context for team strength |
| **Win Percentage** | 20% flat adjustment | 15% weighted by opponent | More nuanced view of wins |

## Key Differences in Calculation

### Current RAPTOR
```python
RAPTOR = (0.3 * eFG%) + (0.25 * NetRating) + (0.2 * WinPct)
```

### Enhanced RAPTOR
```python
RAPTOR = (0.25 * eFG%) + (0.2 * NetRating) + (0.15 * WinPct) +
         (0.1 * HomeAway) + (0.15 * Recent) + (0.1 * Schedule) +
         (0.05 * Rest)
```
