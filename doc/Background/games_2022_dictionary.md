## Derived Statistics
These columns can be used to calculate important basketball metrics:

1. Shooting Percentages:
   - 2PT%: `FGM_2 / FGA_2`
   - 3PT%: `FGM_3 / FGA_3`
   - FT%: `FTM / FTA`

2. Advanced Metrics:
   - Effective Field Goal% (eFG%): `(FGM_2 + 1.5 * FGM_3) / (FGA_2 + FGA_3)`
   - True Shooting% (TS%): `Points / (2 * (FGA_2 + FGA_3 + 0.44 * FTA))`
   - Offensive Rebound%: `OREB / (OREB + opponent_DREB)`

3. Game Impact Metrics:
   - Point Differential: `team_score - opponent_team_score`
   - Possession Estimate: `FGA_2 + FGA_3 - OREB + TOV + (0.44 * FTA)`

## Usage Notes
1. All numeric values are integers unless specified otherwise
2. Distance measurements are typically in miles/kilometers
3. Time-related fields use standard date/time formats
4. Missing values are represented as NA
5. Boolean flags use TRUE/FALSE values
